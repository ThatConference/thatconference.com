				We are committed to the health and safety of all in-person participants of the conference.
				We are constantly monitoring the CDC guidelines and working with the Kalahari Meeting and
				Convention team to accommodate healthy practices in the convention center. While there are
				risks associated with attending an event during a pandemic, the following procedures have
				been created to minimize those risks. We continue to update this page as needed based on
				federal, state, and local mandates and recommendations.
