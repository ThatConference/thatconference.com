				You should see two confirmation emails in your inbox, a receipt from the credit card
				processor and a welcome message from THAT. <span class="font-bold"
					>If you do not see those, please check your junk/spam folders, as sometimes we manage to
					land there accidentally.</span>

					<h4>You have event tickets!!!</h4>

					{#if targetLocations.includes('AT')}
						<p>
							First things first, let's get your travel and rooms sorted. Just head over to our
							travel page for room blocks, addresses, and other details.
						</p>

						<div class="my-8 flex justify-center md:justify-end">
							{#if eventLocation.toUpperCase() === 'WI'}
								<StandardLink href="/support/travel/wi/"

								<StandardLink href="/support/travel/tx/">Book Your Travel To Texas</StandardLink>
							{/if}
						</div>

						<p>
							Soon we will also send you an email asking for your dietary restrictions, shirt sizes,
							and a few other items.
						</p>
					{/if}

					{#if targetLocations.includes('ON')}
						<p>
							No further action is required for your <span class="font-extrabold">ON THAT</span> tickets.
							Ok, small lie there. You now have access to that event and are free to start adding to
							the schedule. That's correct; you can add sessions as well, and make sure to select the
							right event.

				<p>
					You've purchased multiple tickets, and some or all of those tickets now need to be
					allocated to someone. To gain access, that someone has to have a valid account on THAT.us.
					You need that user's email address to assign the ticket. Once assigned, THAT.us will
					contact them and take care of the rest.
				</p>
				{#if targetLocations.includes('AT')}
					<p>
						If one of those tickets is for a spouse or child, they do not need to be allocated, but
